Description: For this project our team will develop a Notepad application where users will be able to view and access notes across web and mobile applications. The application will be developed using frameworks that are common in tech today. This will require the development of a Representational state transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), a constant integration, and a persistence layer. The website should be deployed Heroku. This repository will contain the code base for the mobile application. The mobile app will feature a Room DB that utilizes the web database. Retrofit will be used to access the API.

API: In Progress
